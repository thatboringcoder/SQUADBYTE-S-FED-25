## UI Improvement Recommendations for FirstCry
To enhance usability and drive sales on the FirstCry website, consider the following updates:

- **Increase Brand Visibility**: The 'Brands' section appears undersized. Increasing the font size and prominence of brand names could boost visibility and encourage purchases of premium clothing items.
- **Elevate Moms and Maternity**: The 'Moms and Maternity' section sits too far down the page. Relocating it nearer the top with customizable options can increase visibility, engagement, and personalization.
- **Highlight Parenting Vlogs**: Revise the 'FirstCry Parenting' section on the homepage to prominently feature top vlogs, thereby enhancing the overall user purchase experience.
- **Advertise Early Delivery**: Introduce and promote an early delivery option for selected items to improve customer satisfaction and drive additional sales.

These recommendations aim to improve the overall user experience and better showcase key offerings.

## Prototype
A lightweight `index.html` file demonstrates the proposed UI improvements:
- Early delivery banner placed near the top of the page.
- Moms & Maternity section moved upward with a category selector for personalized tips.
- Enlarged brand names in a prominent section to draw attention to premium labels.
- FirstCry Parenting area featuring highlighted vlogs.

Open `index.html` in any browser to explore the concept.
