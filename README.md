# SQUADBYTE‑S‑FED‑25

This repository contains a prototype homepage for the FirstCry website, built as part of the **InnovateX hackathon**.  The goal of this project is to illustrate how subtle UI changes and closer adherence to the official FirstCry look and feel can improve usability and encourage sales on FirstCry.com.

## Implemented UI Improvements

* **Prominent Brands Section** – A dedicated area at the very top of the page highlights top‑performing brands with bold typography and generous card layouts.  This makes it easier for shoppers to discover premium labels without hunting through menus.

* **Elevated Moms &amp; Maternity** – The maternity category has been moved higher on the page and presented with a compelling banner and call‑to‑action.  The new design brings expectant mothers’ products into view faster while maintaining a clean aesthetic.

* **Featured Parenting Blogs** – To better integrate the FirstCry Parenting platform, the prototype now showcases a **Featured Blogs** section with curated articles. Each card links to informative articles on topics such as raising Generation Beta kids, healthy snack ideas and baby name inspiration. This replacement of the earlier vlog section makes the page lighter and more relevant to readers.

* **Prime Delivery Call‑out** – A promotional block highlights **Prime Delivery**, an upgraded shipping option that offers faster and more reliable delivery on select items. Clear messaging helps customers understand the benefit and increases conversion.

## Running the Prototype

To explore the layout, open `index.html` in any modern web browser.  The design uses only vanilla HTML, CSS and a small amount of JavaScript, and is responsive across desktop and mobile screen sizes.
