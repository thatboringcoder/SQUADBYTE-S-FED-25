# SQUADBYTE‑S‑FED‑25

This repository contains a prototype homepage for the FirstCry website, built as part of the **InnovateX Hackathon 2025**.  The goal of this project is to illustrate how subtle UI changes can improve usability and encourage sales on FirstCry.com.

## Implemented UI Improvements

* **Prominent Brands Section** – A dedicated area at the very top of the page highlights top‑performing brands with bold typography and generous card layouts.  This makes it easier for shoppers to discover premium labels without hunting through menus.

* **Elevated Moms &amp; Maternity** – The maternity category has been moved higher on the page and presented with a compelling banner and call‑to‑action.  The new design brings expectant mothers’ products into view faster while maintaining a clean aesthetic.

* **Featured Parenting Vlogs** – Instead of burying the FirstCry Parenting content, the prototype features a **Top Vlogs** section with embedded videos.  Surfacing engaging parenting content encourages learning and deepens user engagement.

* **Early Delivery Call‑out** – To improve conversion and customer satisfaction, a promotional block advertises an **early delivery option** on selected products.  By explicitly calling out faster shipping, customers know they can get essentials in a hurry.

## Running the Prototype

To explore the layout, open `index.html` in any modern web browser.  The design uses only vanilla HTML, CSS and a small amount of JavaScript, and is responsive across desktop and mobile screen sizes.
