## UI Improvement Recommendations for FirstCry

These suggestions aim to streamline the shopping experience and highlight key offerings:

1. **Increase Brand Visibility** – The 'Brands' section is undersized. Enlarging and emphasizing brand names can draw more attention and encourage premium purchases.
2. **Elevate Moms & Maternity** – This section currently sits far down the page. Moving it nearer the top with customizable options can improve engagement and personalization.
3. **Highlight Parenting Vlogs** – Prominently featuring top 'FirstCry Parenting' vlogs guides shoppers toward curated content and supports better purchasing decisions.
4. **Promote Early Delivery** – Advertising an early-delivery option for select items boosts customer satisfaction and may drive additional sales.

These recommendations aim to improve the overall user experience while keeping the interface focused and uncluttered.
